     The supported content for the &lt;description&gt; element changed from Google Earth 4.3 to 5.0. Specific information for each version is listed out below, followed by information common to both.
     
     # Google Earth 5.0
     
     Google Earth 5.0 (and later) supports plain text content, as well as full HTML and JavaScript, within description balloons. Contents of the description tag are rendered by the [WebKit](http://webkit.org/) open source web browser engine, and are displayed as they would be in any WebKit-based browser.
     
     # General restrictions
     
     Links to local files are generally not allowed. This prevents malicious code from damaging your system or accessing your data. Should you wish to allow access to your local filesystem, select **Preferences > Allow access to local files and personal data**. Links to image files on the local filesystem are always allowed, if contained within an &lt;img&gt; tag.
     
     Content that has been compressed into a KMZ file can be accessed, even if on the local filesystem.
     
     Cookies are enabled, but for the purposes of the same-origin policy, local content does not share a domain with any other content (including other local content).
     
     # HTML
     
     HTML is mostly rendered as it would be in any WebKit browser.
     
     Targets are ignored when included in HTML written directly into the KML; all such links are opened as if the target is set to _blank. Any specified targets are ignored.
     
     HTML that is contained in an iFrame, however, or dynamically generated with JavaScript or DHTML, will use target="_self" as the default. Other targets can be specified and are supported.
     
     The contents of KMZ files, local anchor links, and `;flyto` methods cannot be targeted from HTML contained within an iFrame.
     
     If the user specifies `width="100%"` for the width of an iFrame, then the iFrame's width will be dependent on all the other content in the balloonâ€”it should essentially be ignored while calculating layout size. This rule applies to any other block element inside the balloon as well.
     
     # JavaScript
     
     Most JavaScript is supported. Dialog boxes can not be created - functions such as alert() and prompt() will not be displayed. They will, however, be written to the system console, as will other errors and exceptions.
     
     # CSS
     
     CSS is allowed. As with CSS in a regular web browser, CSS can be used to style text, page elements, and to control the size and appearance of the description balloon.
     
     # Google Earth 4.3
     
     The &lt;description&gt; element supports plain text as well as a subset of HTML formatting elements, including tables. It does not support other web-based technology, such as dynamic page markup (PHP, JSP, ASP), scripting languages (VBScript, Javascript), nor application languages (Java, Python). In Google Earth release 4.2, video is supported.
     
     # Common information
     
     If your description contains no HTML markup, Google Earth attempts to format it, replacing newlines with <br> and wrapping URLs with anchor tags. A valid URL string for the World Wide Web is automatically converted to a hyperlink to that URL (e.g., http://www.google.com). Consequently, you do not need to surround a URL with the `<a href="http://.."></a>` tags in order to achieve a simple link.
     
     When using HTML to create a hyperlink around a specific word, or when including images in the HTML, you must use HTML entity references or the CDATA element to escape angle brackets, apostrophes, and other special characters. The CDATA element tells the XML parser to ignore special characters used within the brackets. This element takes the form of:
     
     ```
     <![CDATA[
     special characters here
     ]]>
     ```
     If you prefer not to use the CDATA element, you can use entity references to replace all the special characters.
     
     
    ```
     <description>
     <![CDATA[
     This is an image
     <img src="icon.jpg">
     ]]>
     </description>
     ```
     
     *Other Behavior Specified Through Use of the &lt;a&gt; Element*
     
     KML supports the use of two attributes within the <a> element: href and type.
     
     The anchor element <a> contains an href attribute that specifies a URL.
     
     If the *href* is a KML file and has a .kml or .kmz file extension, Google Earth loads that file directly when the user clicks it. If the URL ends with an extension not known to Google Earth (for example, .html), the URL is sent to the browser.
     The href can be a fragment URL (that is, a URL with a # sign followed by a KML identifier). When the user clicks a link that includes a fragment URL, by default the browser flies to the Feature whose ID matches the fragment. If the Feature has a LookAt or Camera element, the Feature is viewed from the specified viewpoint.
     
     The behavior can be further specified by appending one of the following three strings to the fragment URL:
     
     - `;flyto` (default) - fly to the Feature
     - `;balloon` - open the Feature's balloon but do not fly to the Feature
     - `;balloonFlyto` - open the Feature's balloon and fly to the Feature
     For example, the following code indicates to open the file CraftsFairs.kml, fly to the Placemark whose ID is "Albuquerque," and open its balloon:
     
     ```
     <description>
     <![CDATA[
     <a href="http://myServer.com/CraftsFairs.kml#Albuquerque;balloonFlyto">
     One of the Best Art Shows in the West</a>
     ]]>
     </description>
     ```
     The type attribute is used within the <a> element when the href does not end in .kml or .kmz, but the reference needs to be interpreted in the context of KML. Specify the following:
     
     
     type="application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml"
     For example, the following URL uses the type attribute to notify Google Earth that it should attempt to load the file, even though the file extension is .php:
     
     ```
     <a href="myserver.com/cgi-bin/generate-kml.php#placemark123"
     type="application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml">
     ```
