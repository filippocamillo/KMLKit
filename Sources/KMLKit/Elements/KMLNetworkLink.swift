 References a KML file or KMZ archive on a local or remote network. Use the &lt;Link&gt; element to specify the location of the KML file. Within that element, you can define the refresh options for updating the file, based on time and camera change. NetworkLinks can be used in combination with Regions to handle very large datasets efficiently.

     A value of 0 leaves the visibility of features within the control of the Google Earth user. Set the value to 1 to reset the visibility of features each time the NetworkLink is refreshed. For example, suppose a Placemark within the linked KML file has &lt;visibility&gt; set to 1 and the NetworkLink has &lt;refreshVisibility&gt; set to 1. When the file is first loaded into Google Earth, the user can clear the check box next to the item to turn off display in the 3D viewer.
