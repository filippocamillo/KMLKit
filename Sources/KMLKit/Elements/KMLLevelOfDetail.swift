 Lod is an abbreviation for Level of Detail. &lt;Lod&gt; describes the size of the projected region on the screen that is required in order for the region to be considered "active." Also specifies the size of the pixel ramp used for fading in (from transparent to opaque) and fading out (from opaque to transparent).

     Defines a square in screen space, with sides of the specified value in pixels. For example, 128 defines a square of 128 x 128 pixels. The region's bounding box must be larger than this square (and smaller than the `maxLodPixels` square) in order for the Region to be active.
